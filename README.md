    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `client` directory and install the necessary dependencies:

    ```

    Edit the `.env` file to specify the desired port:

    ```plaintext
    PORT=3000
    ```

5. **Start Development Servers**: Start the client and server development servers separately:
